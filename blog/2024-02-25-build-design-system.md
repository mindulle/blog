# 자료 조사

[The Design System Guide](https://thedesignsystem.guide/)의 [The Design System Playbook](https://thedesignsystem.guide/design-system-questions)에 있는 질문들에 스스로 답해보며 디자인 시스템 설계 준비를 시작 해 보고자 하였습니다.

## 근본적인 질문

Evaluate where you're now and identify how you want to grow your design system

- 첫 번째 목표는 디자인 시스템을 일단 완성시키는 것 입니다.
- 이 조차 그다지 쉬운 목표가 아닐 것으로 예상됩니다.
- 그럼에도 불구하고 이 디자인 시스템의 성장 가능성을 조금이나마 기대 해 본다면
- 첫 제품 출시에 성공한다면 그 제품에 대한 사용자 피드백이 있을텐데
- 그로부터 개선점을 찾아나갈 수 있을 지도 모른다는 희미한 가능성이 있습니다.
- 현재 시점에선, 사실상 크게 디자인 시스템에 대한 변경이 있기가 힘듭니다.
